# Java Chat Socket Programming

## Overview
This is a simple Java-based chat application that uses socket programming for communication between clients and a server. The application allows multiple clients to connect to the server and exchange messages in a chat-like fashion.

## Features

- **Bi-Directional Communication:** Clients can send and receive messages to/from the server and other connected clients.
- **Multi-User Chat:** Multiple clients can connect to the server simultaneously and participate in a group chat.

## Getting Started
